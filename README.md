# kaggle-chronicles
Welcome to Kaggle Chronicles! This repository is a collection of my notebook solutions for various Kaggle competitions. Each notebook contains detailed solutions, including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and insights gained throughout the competition. 

This repository is just myself improving over time and advancing in the competitions and eventually in the field of ML.(●'◡'●)

# Overview
This repository aims to:
1. Share knowledge and best practices in data science and machine learning.
2. Provide reusable code and techniques for common tasks in Kaggle competitions.
3. Document my learning journey and progress in the field of machine learning.

# Structure
The repository is organized by competition. Each folder contains:

1. Notebook: The main solution notebook in .ipynb format.
2. Data: Data files used in the competition.
3. Models: Trained models and results.
   
# Notebooks
1. [Titanic Survival Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic): This is the most basic and beginner friendly kaggle competition. It involves the prediction whethere a person on the titanic will survive or not. My notebook code in this case was able to achieve an accuracy of 79.665% and a rank of 728/17157.
2. [House Price Prediction - Advanced Regression](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques): A basic and beginner friendly competition on kaggle that deals with the prediction of House Price for a given number of parameters.
