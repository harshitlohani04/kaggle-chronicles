# About this competition

People who come on kaggle to start off their journey in ML often know about this dataset. It is the most basic binary classification problem that involves predicting 
whether a passenger will survive the titanic disaster given some parameters.

In this dataset we have been provided with data related to a passenger in a form of a 12 x 891 .csv file for training the model.

The data involves 3 files:

1. gender_submission.csv --> denoting sample submission format.

2. train.csv --> data for training the model.

3. test.csv --> data for testing the model.
