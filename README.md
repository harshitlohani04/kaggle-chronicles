# kaggle-chronicles
Welcome to Kaggle Chronicles! This repository is a collection of my notebook solutions for various Kaggle competitions. Each notebook contains detailed solutions, including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and insights gained throughout the competition. 

This repository is just myself improving over time and advancing in the competitions and eventually in the field of ML.(●'◡'●)

# Overview
This repository aims to:
1. Share knowledge and best practices in data science and machine learning.
2. Provide reusable code and techniques for common tasks in Kaggle competitions.
3. Document my learning journey and progress in the field of machine learning.

# Structure
The repository is organized by competition. Each folder contains:

1. Notebook: The main solution notebook in .ipynb format.
2. About: This file contains the details regarding the data and the notebook.
   
# Notebooks(Also the sequence in which I took part ^_^)
1. [Titanic Survival Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic): This is the most basic and beginner friendly kaggle competition. It involves the prediction whethere a person on the titanic will survive or not. My notebook code in this case was able to achieve an accuracy of 79.665% and a rank of 728/17157.
2. [House Price Prediction - Advanced Regression](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques): A basic and beginner friendly competition on kaggle that deals with the prediction of House Price for a given number of parameters.
3. [RSNA 2024 Lumbar Spine Degenerative Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-2024-lumbar-spine-degenerative-classification/overview): My 1st proper competition, this competition is quite something. Before this I thought that why does kaggle give months in a competition and this competition has made clear why. The concepts being used in this competition are not just advanced ML but also advanced python. Hope this contest comes out to be great skill upgrade (★‿★).
4. [Binary Classification of Insurance Cross Selling](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e7/overview): My 2nd proper code competition, this competition seems simple because it just is a simple binary classification problem which has 12 columns with no missing values at all. The number of rows in the dataset are quite large like very large, totalling to 11.5M parameters. But still the competition is on a simpler side, quite evident by the time given for it(only a month). I am utilizing this competition to enhance my ML skills and using a proper code structure.
